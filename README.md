# 05-Space-SHMUP
 
Changes: 
- Changed the blaster so that it shoots faster but does less damage 
- Changed the spread so that it contain more projectiles but has a slower delaybetween shots or firerate (essentially acts like a shotgun)
- Added a laser that does damage overtime 
- Tried to add a phaser but instead made it a draw tool so that you can draw whatever you want and when enemies collide with it they take damage 
- Overall wanted to create weapons and balance them.
